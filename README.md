# Dodge the Blocks (Tkinter)

A small and fun Python game made using **Tkinter** — the standard Python GUI library.
You move a little block left and right to avoid falling obstacles!

---

## How to Play

Run the game with:

```bash
python game.py
```

* Use the **Left** and **Right arrow keys** to move your player.
* Avoid the falling blocks.
* Press **Space** to restart after a collision.

Tkinter is already included with Python on Windows, macOS, and Linux — so you don’t need to install anything extra.
